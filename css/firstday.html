        <p style="color: blue; background-color: darkturquoise;">
            London is the capital and largest city of England and the United Kingdom, with a population of just under 9 million.
            It stands on the River Thames London's founding can be traced to 43 CE, 
            when the Roman armies began their occupation of Britain under Emperor Claudius. At a point just north of the marshy valley of the River Thames, where two low hills were sited, they established a settlement they called Londinium. The first definite mention of London occurs in 60 CE by the Roman historian Tacitus.

            It is located within the historic county of Glamorgan (Morgannwg) on the Bristol Channel at the mouth of the River Taff, about 150 miles (240 km) west of London.
